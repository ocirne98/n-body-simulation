# n-body-simulation
This repository contains the classes for a n-body gravitational simulation (newtonian) created with Python.

The files contained are the following:

'Particle.py', a file containing the class called 'Particle', where the properties of the planets are defined.

'solarsystem.py', a file containing the class called 'solarsystem', where the properties defined in the 
'Particle' class are calculated.

'solarsystemtest.py', a file containing the initial conditions of the planets and the loop that updates them
and saves the updated information on a file called 'solarsystemanalysis'.

'Analysis.py', a file opens a file called 'solarsystemanalysis' and appends the data in arrays that are 
then plotted and visualized.

'Report.pdf', a file is a wider description of the code and its purpose.
